Slasti version 2.1-dev
Unfortunately, Oishii was taken, so Slasti it is.

TODO:
 - 2015 - bug - Preload hangs the whole server often
 - add Kris' nonce
 - redo filesystem-based tagbase format with an index, /tags take too long
 - search, aggregate in tags page - for tablets with poor ^F
 - invoke del2sla from an upload form
   - what if pre-existing marks exist? how to merge?
 - dedup URLs (show found ones at the time of entry)
 - localizations
 - configurable templates loaded from text files
 - how about a templatized root (not user's root, the root root in slasti.wsgi)
   - add version to it, extract from where? only in README at present
 - 2.0.1 bookmarklet cannot be used unless already logged in, needs a retry.
 - bookmarklet cannot pre-load a Github page, fails with:
Content Security Policy: The page's settings blocked the loading of a resource at self ("script-src https://assets-cdn.github.com https://collector-cdn.github.com").
 - Implement HEAD, make sure returns no body on error
 - report basic performance data (in-page or out-of-band, either works)
 - "Edit" buttons in page listsings, it's an extra step to edit currently
 - rate-limit logins
 - obey hosts.deny and make sure that denyhosts parses the logs
 - preserve the tag list of the just-deleted mark and display in "Deleted"

fixup TODO for templates:
 - rename "jsondict" into something sensible
 - template docs for 2.0
   - macro variables list - document starting with underscore
 - Run down XXX
