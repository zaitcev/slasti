Slasti version 2.0.1
Unfortunately, Oishii was taken, so Slasti it is.

TODO:
 - redo filesystem-based tagbase format with an index, /tags take too long
 - return an iterateable for XML (people use iterator with yield)
 - search/group tags with javascript for tablets, scrolling too hard
 - tests (Christan's main() in template.py lacked verification)
 - invoke del2sla from an upload form
   - what if pre-existing marks exist? how to merge?
 - dedup URLs (show found ones at the time of entry)
 - search, aggregate in tags page - for tablets with poor ^F
 - localizations
 - make .substitute to return a list-of-strings; million useless .join now
 - replace sgmllib.SGMLParser with something better. Fails at HTML:

 - configurable templates loaded from text files
 - how about a templatized root (not user's root, the root root in slasti.wsgi)
   - add version to it, extract from where? only in README at present

fixup TODO for templates:
 - rename "jsondict" into something sensible
 - template docs for 2.0
   - macro variables list - document starting with underscore
 - Run down XXX
