= requirements

Slasti works through WSGI interface to a webserver, so it needs mod_wsgi.
See INSTALL.mod_wsgi for specifics. It also needs Python 2.6 or thereabout.
No database is used.

= passwords

Slasti stores user passwords hashed at rest, and generates login cookies
using the hash as if it were the plaintext. Obviously, anyone who captures
the hash can fake login cookies, so there is no advantage for us to store
passwords hashed. We only do it as a cortesy to people who use the same
password on several websites.

To configure user passwords, first select a salt. This works:

 dd if=/dev/random bs=6 count=1 2>/dev/null | od -x | awk '{print $2 $3 $4}'

You will save this as "salt" in slasti-users.conf. Then, negotiate the
password with the user. Then, hash them together:

 salt=$(dd if= blah blah blah)
 password=whatever
 echo -n "${salt}${password}" | md5sum

The result of md5sum goes into the "pass" field. See the example
slasti-users.conf for the JSON syntax.
